# CardioRAG-A-RAG-Approach-for-Structured-Information-Access-in-CVD-Healthcare
An AI-powered chatbot that helps answer questions about cardiovascular diseases using trusted medical sources and advanced retrieval methods.


## 🚀 Project Highlights

- 🔍 Uses trusted sources like PubMed, MedQuAD, and clinical guidelines, standard CVD books.
- 🧠 Combines dense/hybrid retrievers (FAISS, BM25) with generative models (GPT, T5, BioGPT).
- 📚 Structured indexing of medical data for efficient retrieval.
- 🛡️ Focuses on clinical safety by reducing hallucinations and performing fact-checking.
- 📊 Evaluates chatbot performance using ROUGE, BERTScore, and domain relevance.
